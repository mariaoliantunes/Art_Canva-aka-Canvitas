This project was developed within the scope of the course Tecnologia de Interface, under the theme Interface Technologies for New Media Art. The interactive artefact is built using Arduino and Processing, and explores the relationship
between physical gesture and digital output in the context of new media art.
The system uses an Arduino Uno, two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, and a buzzer to capture user movement and transform it into dynamic audiovisual feedback.
The sensors detect the proximity of each hand, allowing the user to control visual parameters—such as colour, size, and quantity of elements—as well as sound. By combining physical interaction with generative media, the artefact
invites users to engage with an immersive and responsive environment.
